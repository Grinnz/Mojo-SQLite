3.002     2019-06-21 17:41:35 EDT
  - Changed default SQL::Abstract identifier quoting character to `, as double
    quoted identifiers may be interpreted as string literals if they are not
    valid identifiers. https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html#double_quoted_string_literals_are_accepted

3.001     2018-07-20 20:25:12 EDT
  - Increase DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.54 for FTS5 support.
  - Add db attribute to Mojo::SQLite::Results and use it to prevent connections
    from being cached for reuse while results are active.
  - Add sql_for method to Mojo::SQLite::Migrations.

3.000     2017-07-20 01:16:50 EDT
  - Changed default for max_connections attribute to 1.
  - Added support for sharing the database connection cache between multiple
    Mojo::SQLite objects. (based on Mojo::Pg 4.0)
  - Added parent attribute to Mojo::SQLite.
  - Fixed database connection leak with automatic migrations.
  - Removed deprecated Mojo::SQLite::PubSub and associated methods and attributes.
    SQLite's serverless nature means it does not have the ability to support
    client notifications, so it is not possible to implement an efficient
    pubsub system as in for example PostgreSQL, Redis, or websockets.

  - Deprecate Mojo::SQLite::PubSub and associated methods and attributes.
    SQLite's serverless nature means it does not have the ability to support
