3.007     2021-08-01 20:17:42 EDT
  - Increase DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.68 to support and use sqlite_string_mode over sqlite_unicode (#22, Adam Williamson)
  - The default options now set sqlite_string_mode to DBD_SQLITE_STRING_MODE_UNICODE_FALLBACK,
    unless sqlite_unicode is specified explicitly in from_string or from_filename. This is equivalent
    to the previous behavior but ensures that DBD::SQLite will not return malformed strings.
  - Support wal_mode option to enable WAL journaling mode, which is still currently the default,
    but may not be set by default in a future release.

3.006     2021-06-16 00:30:47 EDT
  - Set default abstract generator to an SQL::Abstract::Pg object, enabling additional features.
  - Update IRC metadata to libera.chat

  - Add query_p, select_p, insert_p, update_p, delete_p Mojo::Promise-returning methods to Mojo::SQLite::Database.
    These are for API compatibility with Mojo::Pg and do not provide non-blocking query functionality. (#20, Stefan Adams)
  - Use Mojo::Promise in tests instead of the deprecated and decored Mojo::IOLoop::Delay (#20, Stefan Adams)

3.004     2020-07-22 22:50:43 EDT
  - The Mojo::SQLite::Migrations sqlite attribute and the
    Mojo::SQLite::Transaction db attribute are now weak attributes, increasing
    the required version of Mojolicious to 8.03.
  - Defer loading of Mojo::IOLoop unless the callback compatibility API is
    used.
  - Newly created mojo_migrations tables from Mojo::SQLite::Migrations will use
    a primary key.
  - Recognize -json parameters in queries.

3.003     2019-10-01 15:49:43 EDT
  - Increase DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.64 to support configuring
    double-quoted string literals.
  - Disable double-quoted string literals for all connections.
    https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html#double_quoted_string_literals_are_accepted
  - Change default SQL::Abstract identifier back to double quote.

3.002     2019-06-21 17:41:35 EDT
  - Changed default SQL::Abstract identifier quoting character to `, as double
    quoted identifiers may be interpreted as string literals if they are not
    valid identifiers. https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html#double_quoted_string_literals_are_accepted

3.001     2018-07-20 20:25:12 EDT
  - Increase DBD::SQLite dependency to 1.54 for FTS5 support.

    Mojo::SQLite objects. (based on Mojo::Pg 4.0)
  - Added parent attribute to Mojo::SQLite.
  - Fixed database connection leak with automatic migrations.
  - Removed deprecated Mojo::SQLite::PubSub and associated methods and attributes.
    SQLite's serverless nature means it does not have the ability to support
    client notifications, so it is not possible to implement an efficient
    pubsub system as in for example PostgreSQL, Redis, or websockets.

2.002     2017-06-01 14:16:34 EDT
  - Add no_wal option to prevent enabling WAL mode on connection.

2.001     2017-02-18 15:36:16 EST

    table and column names.

  - Add abstract attribute to Mojo::SQLite.
  - Add delete, insert, select, and update methods to Mojo::SQLite::Database.

1.004     2017-01-17 00:10:51 EST
  - Use Mojo::File from Mojolicious 7.15 instead of deprecated
    Mojo::Util slurp function. (#9)

1.001     2016-11-15 02:32:27 EST
  - Deprecate Mojo::SQLite::PubSub and associated methods and attributes.
    SQLite's serverless nature means it does not have the ability to support
    client notifications, so it is not possible to implement an efficient
    pubsub system as in for example PostgreSQL, Redis, or websockets.
